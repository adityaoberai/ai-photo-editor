# Windsurf Prompt: AI Photo Editor Web App (SvelteKit + PixiJS)

---

## Overview

I want to build a **web-based AI-powered photo editor** for photographers.  
The app should combine **AI-driven photo analysis** with **manual professional-grade editing tools**, powered by **GPU-accelerated WebGL rendering** via **PixiJS**.

The editing experience must be **fast, mobile-optimized**, and support **high-resolution images** from day one.

AI should be used **only** for **photo analysis** and **text-to-edit translation** â€” **not** for directly modifying pixels.

All backend logic must live inside **SvelteKit server-only modules**.  
No Dockerization is needed â€” the app should be deployable easily to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Node.js servers.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Photo Upload & Display
- Upload high-resolution images (JPEG, PNG; optional RAW support later).
- Load uploaded images as **PixiJS sprites** inside a WebGL canvas.
- Enable zooming, panning, and fit-to-screen viewing.
- Extract and display EXIF metadata (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, camera model).

### 2. AI-Powered Photo Analysis (Advisory Only)
- Users can input free-text prompts like:
  > "How can I improve this photo?"
- AI analyzes the uploaded image and/or prompt and returns:
  - A description of the photo's issues (e.g., underexposed, low contrast).
  - A structured list of recommended edits (e.g., "Increase exposure by 20", "Add warmth by 10").
- Users manually review and apply suggested edits via sliders.

### 3. Manual Photo Editing Tools (WebGL Filters)
Provide real-time, GPU-accelerated adjustments using PixiJS filters:
- **Basic Adjustments**: Exposure, brightness, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks.
- **Color Controls**: Temperature, tint, vibrance, saturation, HSL adjustments.
- **Tone Curve Editor** (optional later).
- **Details & Effects**: Texture, clarity, sharpening, noise reduction, vignette, grain.
- **Transform Tools**: Crop, rotate, flip, straighten.
- **Before/After Preview**: Toggle to view original versus edited versions.

Each adjustment directly updates WebGL shader uniforms for live feedback.

### 4. Text-to-Edit Translation (Auto-Apply AI Suggestions)
- Users input creative descriptions like:
  > "Make this look like an early morning beach shot."
- AI backend translates the description into a structured set of filter adjustments.
- App automatically applies the edits via WebGL shaders.
- Users retain full control to tweak or undo auto-applied edits.

### 5. Edit History (Undo/Redo)
- Track a full history of user actions.
- Enable undo and redo operations seamlessly.
- Support optional "snapshots" to allow branching edits.

### 6. Export & Save
- Export the final edited photo from the WebGL canvas as:
  - High-resolution JPEG or PNG.
- Allow export of applied settings as:
  - A JSON file for future reuse or sharing.

## Mobile Editing UI

Mobile-first, touch-optimized editing experience:
- Large, responsive sliders and buttons.
- Swipe gestures for Before/After comparisons.
- Bottom-drawer interface for editing tools.
- Single-column layout focused on image editing.
- PWA-ready (Progressive Web App) for home-screen installation and offline editing.

---

## Tech Architecture

### Frontend
- Framework: **SvelteKit**
- Rendering: **PixiJS** (WebGL)
- Real-time edits applied through WebGL shaders
- Responsive and mobile-optimized

### Backend
- Built into **SvelteKit server-only modules** (`+server.ts` or `+server.js`).
- Responsibilities:
  - Process AI analysis requests and text-to-edit translations.
  - Manage upload metadata extraction (optional).

### AI Integration
- Use external AI APIs (OpenAI Vision, Replicate, or similar) for:
  - Descriptive image analysis and improvement suggestions.
  - Text-to-edit translation (mapping creative prompts to structured edits).
- Important:  
  AI only **generates settings**. Pixel editing is done locally via WebGL.

### Image Processing
- Apply all edits using GPU-accelerated WebGL shaders through PixiJS.
- No server-side image manipulation.

---

## Deployment
- Standard full-stack SvelteKit app.
- No Dockerization.
- Deployable to Vercel, Netlify, or traditional Node.js hosting.
